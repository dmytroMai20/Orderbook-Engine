# TODO
 - make this NUMA / cache-line aware
 - remove the EngineEventType enum entirely (variant-only dispatch)
 - implement prune good for day orders in matching engine rather than orderbook itself
 - change file name of SPSCRingBuffer
 - MacOS does not support core pinning (affinity), port for Linux?
